CHAPTER I

THE CANOE BUILDER

DICK standing on a ledge of coral cast his eyes to the South.

Behind him the breakers of the outer sea thundered and the spindrift scattered on the wind; before him stretched an ocean calm as a lake, infinite, blue, and flown about by the fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin.

Clipped by its forty-mile ring of coral this great pond was a sea in itself, a sea of storm in heavy winds, a lake of azure, in light airs—and it was his—he who had landed here only yesterday.

Women, children, youths, all the tribe to be seen busy along the beach in the blazing sun, fishing with nets, playing their games or working on the paraka patches, all were his people. His were the canoes drawn up on the sand and his the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.

Then as he cast his eyes from the lagoon to the canoe houses his brow contracted, and, turning his back to the lagoon he stood facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Away there,  ​beyond  the sea line, invisible, lay Palm Tree, an island beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.

Little Tari the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sitting on the coral close by, looked up at him. Tari knew little of life, but he knew that all the men of Karolin swept away by war had left the women and the boys and the children like himself defenceless and without a man or leader.

Then, yesterday, from the northern sea in a strange boat and with Katafa, the girl who had been blown to sea years ago when out fishing, this strange new figure had come, sent by the gods, so the women said, to be their chief and ruler.
Rewritten:
Now he saw Dick frowning and his eyes turned away from the lagoon to the northern sea.

"What is that you are looking at?" Tari asked.

"Palm Tree," Dick answered.

"Is it true that it is full of devils?"

"I do not know, but it is the place from which I have come."

"Who are you?"

"Dick," he answered.

"Dick?"

"Yes, Dick."

"Who are you, Dick?"

"A canoe builder," Dick answered.

"I do not understand," said Tari.

"I am a man who builds canoes," Dick explained.

"Then why are you frowning?"

"I am frowning because I have left my canoes in Palm Tree and I want to go back and get them."

"I thought you had come to be our chief and ruler," said Tari.

"I have come to live here and to help you all," Dick answered, "but I must first go back and get my canoes."

"But how can you get back? The sea is very big and you have no canoe."

"I will build one," Dick answered.

"How long will it take you to build a canoe?"

"I do not know, but I will build one as soon as I can."

"Then I will go with you," said Tari, "for I want to see your canoes and to learn how to build them."

"Very well," Dick answered. "You may go with me."

"But you must not build a canoe too big for me to handle," said Tari, "for I am little and I could not manage a big canoe."

"I will build a canoe that you can handle," Dick answered.

"But you must not build it too small," said Tari, "for I want to learn to handle a big canoe."

"I will build a canoe that you can handle and that is big enough for you to learn to handle," Dick answered.

"Then let us go and begin," said Tari, "for I want to learn to build canoes."
